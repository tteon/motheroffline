- Written in pure Rust for performance and safety
- IVF (Inverted File Index) implementation
- Brute-force fallback for baseline comparison
- Multi-threaded search using [`rayon`](https://docs.rs/rayon/)
- Python bindings via [`PyO3`](https://pyo3.rs/)
- Easy integration from Python (e.g., Jupyter notebooks)
- CSV loading or synthetic data generation supported
